# Contributing to mkproj  
  
  First of all, thanks a lot for taking a look at this project. I hope it can be of use to someone.
  
  My goals with this are to continue to add features and eventually branch out into other languages besides Python. It would be neat if it could be configured to jumpstart projects from a "menu" of languages. To do this properly would require some kind of configuration file with a standard set of parameters for each language 
  
  there would have to be a less idiosyncratic way of handling the positional parameters in the arguments.
