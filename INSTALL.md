# Installing mkproj  

**mkproj** is a family of three bash functions that work together to set up a Python project folder.

## Compatibility

**mkproj** has been tested on **Ubuntu 20.04** in **GNU bash, version 5.0.17**.
The scripts should work in other bash 5.0+ environments (assuming Python 3.6+ is installed), but until further testing is done, users on other systems and/or shells are advised to practice caution with these scripts. Fortunately, nothing terrible is going to happen! If any problems are found, however, please don't hesitate to open an issue.

## Files to be installed  
`$ mkproj` <-- parent function  
`$ mkvenv` <-- child function #1  
`$ mkrepo` <-- child function #2  
  
### To install `$ mkproj`, `$ mkvenv`, and `$ mkrepo`:  

1) Fork the **mkproj** repo to your GitHub account.

2)
